I have extensive experience as a project leader and contributor on GitHub. I regularly publish my projects and articles on GitHub and LinkedIn, aiming to benefit the IT-community. I completed several projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to optimize page layouts. Additionally, I developed projects in C++ and Java to deepen my understanding and gain experience as a beginner. My primary goal is to continuously improve my skills in web design and development

Skills: HTML / CSS / PHP / Java / JavaScript
